# JavaScript Projects

This repository contains a collection of JavaScript projects created for learning, experimenting, and demonstrating different JavaScript functionalities. Each project is designed to showcase various JavaScript concepts and features, providing both beginners and advanced learners with practical examples.

## Projects Included

1. **Color Flipper**
   - A simple project that changes the background color of the page to a random color each time a button is clicked.
   - Check out the [Color Flipper](https://github.com/riya0704/JavaScript-colorFliper) project for more details.

2. **Counter**
   - A simple counter application that lets users increment, decrement, and reset a counter value. This project demonstrates the use of DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript.

3. **Quote Generator**
